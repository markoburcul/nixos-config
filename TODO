# MUST
- setup VPN - using tailscale should be easy to set up
  - create an exit node and set it up on your mac or phone
- add terraform code for machines
- add rate limiting to nginx
- describe the mtls setup and certificate generation for nginx in either README in root or per host
- take a look at the eth2prod grafana dashboards and upgrade the geth dashboard 

# NICE TO HAVE
- find out how to pass secret from a file to systemd service using https://systemd.io/CREDENTIALS/
- setup landing page - almost done
- try to refactor a role so it can be reused i.e. mutiple nodes running on a server

# DONE
- create monitoring/alerting stack
  - almost done, I need to set up the nginx to expose it
- setup nginx to use private certificates to access the website
  - https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-management-suite/admin-guides/configuration/secure-traffic/
- claim domain for the server
- add loki for logs for monitoring setup
- move the monitoring setup to a shared cpu cloud hetzner host and if possible set it up with nixos
