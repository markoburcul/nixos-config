# MUST
- add terraform code for machines
- describe the mtls setup and certificate generation for nginx in either README in root or per host
- add configuration for your laptop
- create alerting for services:
  - alertmanager
  - sending mail when service fails https://pascal-wittmann.de/entry/systemd-failure-notification
    - https://github.com/pSub/configs/blob/master/nixos%2Fserver%2Fmodules%2Fsystemd-email-notify.nix
    - not for all of the services but just for critical
- automate landing page nginx config generation based on the exposed services on server
- scrape Beaconcha API and add that data to grafana and visualize it
  - here is an example with Telegram https://gist.github.com/richard-ramos/5ae07f56cd5d4e1441e872bf0a60c9b4
- buy more validators on holesky

# NICE TO HAVE
- find out how to pass secret from a file to systemd service using https://systemd.io/CREDENTIALS/
- try to refactor a role so it can be reused i.e. mutiple nodes running on a server

# DONE
- create monitoring/alerting stack
- setup nginx to use private certificates to access the website
  - https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-management-suite/admin-guides/configuration/secure-traffic/
- claim domain for the server
- add loki for logs for monitoring setup
- move the monitoring setup to a shared cpu cloud hetzner host and if possible set it up with nixos
  - https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Install_NixOS_on_Hetzner_Cloud
- created VPN using Nebula from Slack
- add mev-boost service
  - list of relays https://enchanted-direction-844.notion.site/6d369eb33f664487800b0dedfe32171e?v=985cb7e521de43d78c67b7ad29adec84
  - keys are generated
  - there is already a mev-boost pkg so you need to construct a service
  - I already added flags to nimbus beacon node related to the mev-boost
- add application dashboard to landing role and refactor it even more(Dashy)
- add rate limiting to nginx
- take a look at the eth2prod grafana dashboards and upgrade the geth dashboard
